-----------------
To make the new unified comserv under solaris, type:

	make -f Makefile.solaris

To make the new unified comserv under linux type:

	make -f Makefile.linux

To install either, type:

	make -f Makefile.xxxxx install

and for linux, the executables will be placed in ../bin/Linux and
for solaris ../bin/Solaris (relative to this directory src).

==========================================================================================



These are the old installation instructions for comserv4linux
==========================================================================================
INSTALLATION
First, choose a directory where you plan to install the bundle, as in example

cd /home/user

and copy comserv_linux.tar.gz in this direcory
Next, you have to upack the archive using gunzip and tar programs

gunzip comserv_linux.tar.gz
tar xvf comserv_linux.tar

After the distribution is unpacked, the directory structure looks like in the Figure
Executables in the comserv/bin/Linux directory are compiled for Linux and can be used instantly.
Executables in the comserv/bin/Solaris directory are compiled for big-endian Solaris
computers and are also ready to use
If you intend to use the software on other platforms or you are plannign to store data in
big-endian order in shared memory of comserv server under Linux you have to recompile
the distribution.

When the distribution is unpacked and (if needed) is recompiles, an operator should edit
configuration files network.ini, stations.ini and station.ini . Each station.ini file
should reside in it's own directory. Files network.ini and stations.ini should be copied
 into the directory /etc (one should have super-user privileges to do this!).

==============================================================================================
COMPILATION:

Generally, there is no need to compile the programs.
A directory bin contains two subdirectories: Solaris and Linux,
which contain the precompiled executable programs for Solaris and Linux correspondingly.

Nevertheless, compilation is an easy task to perform.
In order to compile the release for Linux, cd to the  $RELEASE/src directory and type

make

This command recursively compiles the distribution, assuming that gcc compiler and linker are installed.

To compile the release for Solaris, you have to issue the command

make solaris.

This command recursively calls make -f makefile.solaris in the src subdirectories
to compile the Solaris binaries. Surely, you have to execute compilation on the
Solaris platform. You must have SUN /usr/ucb/cc compiler installed on you Solaris computer.
To compile the program with gcc, you have to modify the makefile.solaris
files manually in each src directory.

The second command

make clean

cleans object files.  To install the newly compiled binaries in the
default $(RELEASE)/bin directory, type

make install

Note, that make install installs the binary files in $(RELEASE)/bin directory,
whereas precompiled files in $(RELEASE)/bin/Solaris  and $(RELEASE)/bin/Linux
directories are left untouched.

The precompiled Linux comserv program stores data in MiniSEED format in
shared memory ring buffers according to the following convention: MiniSEED
headers are stored in little-endian byte order; compressed data are stored
in big-endian byte-order.

You can modify Makefile in $(RELEASE)/src/comserv directory and recompile
comserv to force it to store MiniSEED headers in big-endian byte order.
In order to do this you have to add the -D_BIG_ENDIAN_HEADER flag to the
 CFLAG line of $(RELEASE)/src/comserv/Makefile.
