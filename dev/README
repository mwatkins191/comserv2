This unified COMSERV bundle contains the comserv server and several clients
which together provide a communication/data link with Quanterra Inc. digitizers.

In addition to COMSERV, for older quanterras, this version includes MountainAir,
or qmaserv, for Q330 digitizers. The MountainAir version is v1.1.1 and also
includes the Q3302EW program which will compile under Windows or Solaris.

This version supports Linux OS (little-endian computers), or can be
compiled for big-endian computers (primarily Sun Sparc, running Solaris).

This version is based on the Solaris version of COMSERV bundle 000518
(comserv server v.31). The earlier version of this bundle is
comserv4linux.010319 (comserv server v.32).

COMSERV was ported to Linux by Ilya Dricker (i.dricker@isti.com),
Instrumental Software Technologies, Inc. under the contract with Kinemetrics, Inc.

The original big-endian version of COMSERV is written by Quanterra, Inc. and is
maintained by Doug Neuhauser (doug@seismo.berkeley.edu).
A vanilla big-endian version is available at
