The cstrigserv program is a comserv client that can accept messages from a UDP
port and control comm detectors on the Quanterra through the comserv
interface.

The cstrigserv program by default has a comserv client name of CSTR, and it
reads its configuration information from the global comserv stations.ini file
and station-specific station.ini file.

Below is a list of configuration parameters for cstrigserv.  The program can be configured
to receive messages from up to 16 distinct UDP addresses.

[cstr]
* ip port to listen on
ipport=19001
* valid ip addrs to receive udp msgs from.
* there can be up to 16 addresses listed.
udpaddr1=192.168.101.2
udpaddr2=192.168.101.3
udpaddr3=192.168.101.5
* optional - my ip address for ack messages.
myaddr=192.168.1.101.2
* optional - path to lock file.
lockfile=path

Cstrigserv recognizes the following format messages:

1.  Explicitly set one or more commdet flags.
seq_no SET commdet1 value1 commdet2 value2 ... commdetN valueN
	Set the specified commdet flags to the specified values.
	1 = enable, 0 = disable.

2.  Trigger one or more commdet flags for a specified duration.
seq_no TRIGGER duration commdet1 commdet2 ... commdetN
	Set the specified commdet flags to trigger for the specified
	duration (in seconds).

3.	Reset server.
seq_no  RESET
	Reset any cached trigger information in the server.
	BEWARE:  This can leave comm detectors turned on permanently!

where:
	seq_no: unsigned integer
	commdet1 ... commdetN:  Comm detector names (eg HON, BON, etc).
				At most 32 commdet strings per message.
	duration:		duration time for trigger in seconds.
