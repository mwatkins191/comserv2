 COMSERV software bundle (version comserv4linux.010319) is a version of COMSERV,
 which  is ported to Linux.  A distribution contains binary executable files 
for Linux (bin/Linux) and Solaris (bin/Solaris).

This version is based on version of COMSERV 000518 (comserv server version 31).

This release is almost compatible with the version COMSERV.000518 (comserv version 31) 
of the official SOLARIS/OS9 release.   The only newly added
feature of version 32 is the ability of comserv to set the SEED byte-order bits
(bit 6 and 7) in I/O and clock flags byte of the fixed MiniSEED header.
In particular, comserv (v.32) running on big-endian computer (SUN),
sets bit 7 to ON in I/O and clock flags byte of each MiniSEED header to indicate
that the header byte order is big-endian. Previous versions of comserv do not modify
the I/O and clock flags byte of a fixed header. See COMSERV section below for more
information on setting byte-order bits.

The precompiled Linux comserv program stores data in MiniSEED format in shared
memory ring buffers according to the following convention: MiniSEED headers are
stored in little-endian byte order; compressed data are stored in big-endian byte-order.

You can modify Makefile in $(RELEASE)/src/comserv directory and recompile comserv
to force it to store MiniSEED headers in big-endian byte order.
In order to do this you have to add the -D_BIG_ENDIAN_HEADER flag to the CFLAG
line of $(RELEASE)/src/comserv/Makefile.
